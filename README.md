<h1>Honeypot Simulator</h1>

<h3>What it is</h3>
> "A honeypot is a cybersecurity decoy designed to attract and study cyberattacks. It's a fake, isolated system or network that mimics a real target, luring attackers away from genuine assets. By monitoring attacker activity on the honeypot, security professionals can gain valuable intelligence about attack methods, tools, and motivations, leading to improved security practices"

So you can imagine it as a trap to fool attackers. THink of it as a reverse phishing attempt.

<h3>How it works</h3>
A user can do into the given website, and try to poke around the inner workings of it (accessing the admin, login or other pages). When they do, it is logged in Logstash. Furthermore, we can create a dashboard using Kibana to help determine the attacker's techniques and tactics.

<h3>But...why?</h3>
As  someone who works as a TSE (Technical Support Engineer) we get a lot of cases of potiential Account Take Overs (ATO), and wanted to dive a little deeper into how we can better protect our clients.
